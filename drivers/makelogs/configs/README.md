# Example Configurations
This folder contains a number of example configuration files that can be used to generate data together with the text and JSON data they correspond to. The files are named according to the following convention:

**\<name\>\_\<message field\>\_\<integer fields\>\_\<string fields\>\_\<text length\>.json**

* **name** - Name of the configuration type
* **message field** - Indicator whether @message field is stored on event of not. Allowed values are *msg* (@message field included) and *nomsg* (@message field not included).
* **integer fields** - Number of random integer fields in the events generated.
* **string fields** - Number of string fields in the events generated.
* **text length** - Average length of the text field.

The directory named *example_data* contain examples of data generated with these sample configurations. These follow the same naming convention as the configuration files. Files that end in *.json* contains generated JSON output and files ending in *.txt* contains the raw *@message* fields generated by the configuration.
