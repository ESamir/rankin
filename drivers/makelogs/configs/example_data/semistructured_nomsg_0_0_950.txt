An example, if you created VM Network in the Standard Switch: vSwitch0 with only the Physical Adaptater vmnic0, VM Network 1 in a new Standard Switch: vSwitch1 with vmnic1, and so on : it's a hard way to create a 1:1 relationship between vNICs and pNICs.  You have to fully understand how network basis virtualization works.  Also, may I help you :I saw in your screenshot, you're using, maybe for example, an adapter type E1000.  May I suggest to you, for optimization, using the vmxnet3 after installing the VMware tools or Open-VM-Tools (easy way with linux from package manager).  Here more information about Choosing a network adapter for your virtual machine :Choose network adapter  In some workloads, you may prefer the direct I/O, pass-trough technology provides by compatible Intel CPU like the VT-d Intel solution (check Ark Intel and Motherboard requirements).  This allow you to remove the physical adapter from the host, vSwitchs and connect it directly to the virtual machine in the edit settings pop up of a virtual machine.Find the way to proceed with configure Pass-trough in Advanced Settings sub link of Configuration tab in your selected host.  Hybride solution who clearly improves performance (this is the true way to 1:1), but disable some basics functions provides by a virtualization solution like Snapshots, Clone, vMotion, ... use it carefully.

Subdomains are just separate VirtualHost configurations. The names don't matter. i.e., to Apache, mail.domain.com and mail.anotherdomain.com are as different as mail.domain.com and mail2.domain.com.  e.g.:  &lt;VirtualHost 192.168.1.1:80&gt;  ServerName mail.mysite.com  DocumentRoot /home/mysite.com/sites/mail/public_html  ...&lt;/virtualHost&gt;&lt;VirtualHost 192.168.1.1:80&gt;  ServerName admin.mysite.com  DocumentRoot /home/mysite.com/sites/admin/public_html  ...&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;...  etc. Repeating VirtualHost sections for each site. The DocumentRoot path is arbitrary. It could live in /var/www (which is common on some Linux systems), or wherever. If the system only has one domain on it, and you want the subdomains to seem more separate (and be owned by different users for SuExec purposes, which may be advisable from a security perspective), you could create a separate user for each domain and put them into their own home directories. But, home directories are also arbitrary, so you could have multiple users with the above example Apache configuration. But, you may want to make them /home/mail, /home/admin, /home/otherstuff, if they don't need to share access to files.  Note: if your system has SELinux or AppArmor, the location of DocumentRoots may be fixed by your OS or the Apache package you're using. Likewise, if you use SuExec, the path is often compiled into the suexec binary (it is configurable on Debian and Ubuntu when you use the suexec-custom package, it is hardcoded to /var/www on CentOS, unless you install a different Apache build or rebuild Apache yourself). So, it may be easiest for you to use the default path unless you have reasons to choose others. I like for users to live in /home however, so I use a rebuilt Apache package with suexec set to /home on my CentOS systems.

If the format of this file is sparse, then the backups will initially be faster. However as time passes and files are created and deleted, the sparse image may not remain as sparse. Eventually the image may end up being much larger than the files within, which of course wastes space on both disk and tape, and slows down backups compared to the speed when the image was new.  Another drawback of the image is that if it is being backed up while any writes are being performed to the file system inside the image, you may end up with a backup where integrity is not preserved.
