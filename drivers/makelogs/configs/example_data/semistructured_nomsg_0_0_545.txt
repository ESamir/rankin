I also have an application that writes a file to the mapped drive (regularly scheduled, but monitored by e-mail).  Periodically a router in between the first server and the second server gets rebooted (either due to maintenance or as part of a weekly reboot schedule - it gets rebooted whether it needs it or not).  If I have an Explorer window open and connected to the mapped drive during this reboot, the mapped drive becomes inaccessible. If I don't everything carries on tickety-bo.  Why?

A lot of users use the same passwords for EVERYTHING.  If you have their network password then chances are you have the password for their personal email, photobucket, facebook, whatever.
