#Test Data
This directory holds example files containing a few different types of data that can be used when generating random log events using the *makelogs* driver containing string and/or text fields. 

All files follow the same naming convention: *\<type of data\>\_\<average line length\>\_\<number of lines in file\>.txt*

## Random strings
Files starting with *strings_* contain strings randomly generated through a [random string generator](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/random-string-generator/). These strings are made up of upper and swell as lower case letters and digits.

## Random texts
Files starting with *text_* contain lines with text randomly generated through a [random text generator](http://randomtextgenerator.com).

## Random ServerFault.com posts
Files starting with *serverfault_* contain a selection of posts from the serverfault.com website that have been formatted to remove special characters. The data was based on an extract from the publicly available [StackExchange data dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange).
